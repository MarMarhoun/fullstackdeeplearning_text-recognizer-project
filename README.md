# Full Stack Deep Learning project Labs

Project developed during lab sessions of the [Full Stack Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://fall2019.fullstackdeeplearning.com/).

* I will build a handwriting recognition system from scratch, and deploy it as a web service.
* Uses Keras, but designed to be modular, hackable, and scalable
* Provides code for training models in parallel and store evaluation in Weights & Biases
* I will set up continuous integration system for our codebase, which will check functionality of code and evaluate the model about to be deployed.
* I will package up the prediction system as a REST API, deployable as a Docker container.
* I will deploy the prediction system as a serverless function to Amazon Lambda.
* Lastly, I will set up monitoring that alerts us when the incoming data distribution changes.
